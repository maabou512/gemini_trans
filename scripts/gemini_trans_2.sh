# Machine Translation using Gemini API 
# Command: 
# bash ../scripts/gemini_trans_1.sh [arg1]
# arg1: original file to be translated  

# Steps ( [x] : This script's scope)  
## [ ] 1. Convert original file (such as HTML) into XLIFF(.xlf) using **Tikal** 
## [ ] 2. Extract JP part which will be translated by Gemini
## [ ] 3. Make patch file for 1 and 2 
## [ ] 4. Translate with Python script 
## [x] 5. Compare line counts pre-translated file and post-translated file
## [x] 6. Apply reverse patch file made in step 3 to merge translated JP parts into XLIFF
## [ ] 7. Create final, translated file(such as HTML) 

#Note: step 1-4 is done in previous process (gemini_trans_1.sh) ã€€
